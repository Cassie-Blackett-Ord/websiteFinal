  <h1>
    Doubtless Hobbes is considered one of the forefathers of modern political philosophy, but with his fame has grown a reputation for supporting ‘easy tyranny’ (Tarlton, 1999: 221). This essay will consider Hobbes’s reasoning for the formation of sovereign power through an analysis of his perception of the state of nature and the state of war. It will then move on to consider why he finds sovereignty must be ‘absolute’ and ‘undivided’ and whether these ideas are consistent with the rest of his writing. Ultimately, much of the criticism against Hobbes’s formation of sovereign power fails to appreciate the superiority of a Commonwealth when compared to the state of warre, and without an understanding of the latter, the reasoning behind Hobbes’s endorsement of the former is unclear. Consequently, this essay will focus on the inconsistencies in Hobbes’s argument rather than the practical enforcement of the idea, in its appraisal of the notions of absolute and undivided sovereignty.

    State of Nature

    Hobbes begins his social analysis from an appraisal of the state of nature, and thus his forthcoming arguments on the ideal structuring of society stem from this foundation. In opposition to the philosophical precedent set down by Aristotle that men are naturally unequal in terms of their endowments (Aristotle,  2009: Section 1254b), Hobbes argues nature has made broadly ‘equall’ (Chapter 13). In further dissent with previous thinkers Hobbes suggests that while the bodily difference in men ‘is not so considerable… the faculties of mind’ are of even greater equality’ (Chapter 13). The defence for this opinion in the parity of intellect is that in general contentedness with one’s ‘share’ is indicative of ‘equal distribution’, man’s common belief that there are not so ‘many as wise as themselves’ (Chapter 13). While this natural equality, may suggest a communal solidarity, it instead breeds uncertainty for all have the power to kill each other and consequently, through ‘anticipation’ of threats to their safety men desire to ‘master the persons of all men... Till he see no other power great enough to endanger him’ (Chapter 13). It is from this deficit of means for man ‘to secure himself’ (Chapter 13) which Hobbes refers to as ‘diffidence’ and results in the state of nature being a state of ‘continual feare’ and men receiving ‘no pleasure’ but instead ‘a great deal of grief’ (Chapter 13).
    
    
    State of War
    
    The role of ‘diffidence’ is but one of the ‘three principal causes of quarrel’ alongside ‘competition’ and ‘glory’, the first seeing men ‘invade... for safety’, the second ‘for gain’, the third ‘for reputation’ (Chapter 13). Without restriction these quarrels become a perpetual state a ‘state of warre’, which does not simply refer to the state of battle, but in ‘the tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is sufficiently known’ (Chapter 13). This understanding of the state of war has been challenged, initially by Locke who argues that the ‘state of nature’ and ‘state of war’ are as dissimilar as a ‘state of peace, goodwill, mutual assistance and preservation’ is from ‘a state of enmity, malice, violence and mutual destruction’ (Locke, 2017: Chapter 3). Yet Locke, and others (Merriam, 1906: 152)  are misguided in believing that Hobbes entirely conflates the ‘state of nature’ with the ‘state of war’ (Locke, 2017: Chapter 3), for they fail to stipulate the contingency of the state of war on the state of nature. Furthermore, while the state of nature, affects the individual destinies of men, and consigns them to a life of ‘no pleasure’, the state of warre impedes any sort of social progression ‘no place for industry’, ‘no culture’, ‘no ...time, no arts, no letters, no society’ (Chapter 13). 
    
    Hobbes’s Aim for Society
    
    The state of war deriving, as it does from the state of nature, which in turn is contingent upon the ‘equality of ability’ of men, must be resolved by a structural inequality, which manifests as ‘a common power to keep them in awe’ (Chapter 13). We must here consider the role of the laws of nature, which are contradictory to the state of nature in so far as they invoke ‘justice, equity, modesty, mercy’ (Chapter 17). Yet while the first ‘fundamental’  law of nature, from which the other laws are derived, sets forth that ‘every man ought to endeavour Peace’ (Chapter 17), the caveat that ‘when he cannot obtain it...he may seek...all… advantages of warre’ (Chapter 17), demonstrates the fragility of peace when the option of ‘warre’ is always available. This is the background onto which Hobbes imposes his idea of a social contract, which advocates the populace transfer some of their rights to a sovereign who in return will ensure peace and stability. Thus Hobbes invokes sovereignty to end the ‘warre of Everyone Against Everyone’ (Chapter 13), yet the desire for an end to the state of war does not stem from the innate value of peace, but rather a striving towards the social products civilisations have come to value, ‘culture’, ‘arts’ and the above. Indeed, central to this time is a moral relativism which arises from ‘the notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice’ (Chapter 13) signifying mere ‘appetites and aversions’ (Chapter 15) without legal credibility or sovereign authority to make them absolute. Tarlton in his critical evaluation of Hobbes notes that the first seventeen chapters depict the ‘logical development to the rational necessity from which commonwealth issues’(1999: 222) demonstrating how Hobbes focus on arriving at the goal of sovereign power, resulted in him using reverse methodology to explain the state of nature by working backwards from the commonwealth. As a result, Hobbes’s solution to the state of nature can be considered teleological, as it is only under the authority of a supreme sovereign that society is able to progress to the stage it has reached in Hobbes’s lifetime, as is his ultimate aim. 
    
    Why the Sovereignty must be absolute
    
    By ‘absolute’ Hobbes refers to the the intractable state of sovereign power, which ultimately cannot be contested. The tenets of absolute rule are set down in De Cive in which Hobbes declares that ‘the sword of justice belongs to him who hath the chief command’ and ‘whatsoever he does is unpunishable’ (Hobbes, 1984: Chapter 6). This indisputable nature applies not just to the commander but the commands themselves, which cannot be resisted without breaking the covenant.  However, Hobbes formation of ‘absolute’ sovereignty is problematic when we consider the relativism of what man considers right and wrong, as he has already described. Hobbes recognises the subjectivity of social norms, ‘private appetite’ differs from man to man and even ‘the same man in diverse times from himself’, and thus ‘good and evil’ being merely  indicators of that which one likes or dislikes (Chapter 15). In the state of nature the natural equality of man logically results in the natural equality of opinions, thus there is no hierarchy of values, or universal acknowledgement of ‘good’ or ‘evil’. The implication is, an absolute ruler is thus ‘to be judge of what opinions and doctrines are averse’ and will enjoy ‘the whole power of prescribing the rules’ (Chapter 18), therefore resolving the issue of moral ambiguity. However, Hobbes has already delineated a set of absolute laws by which men ought to strive to live: the Natural Laws. Indeed, Hobbes’ declaration that the sovereign exercises ‘the whole power of prescribing the rules’ (Chapter 18) is incompatible with the avowal that ‘the laws of nature are immutable and eternal’ (Chapter 15). Hobbes does allude to the distinct purposes of each, in Chapter 17 he suggests that if ‘a great multitude of men’ did ‘consent in the observation of justice… without a common power to keep them all in awe’ there would be no need, either for ‘civil government’ or ‘commonwealth’ (Chapter 17). This implies that civil law comes into existence where natural law fails to become compelling. Yet here Hobbes commits himself to another inconsistency for as already stipulated, if ‘injustice is no other than the not performance of a covenant’(Chapter 15), ‘justice’ we must reason is the performance of a covenant, which, Hobbes commits earlier are only valid when there is a fear of retribution lest the covenant not be completed (Chapter 15). Consequently, justice cannot exist in the state of nature, which without said common power, lacks covenants. As such there is a missing link in the trajectory that moves from the lawless state of nature, to the absolute rule of a commonwealth, which Hobbes, by appealing to his own notion of ‘justice’ fails to justify. 
    
    In fact Hobbes never addresses the problem of subjectivity in his writing, and as a result the criticism can be weighed against both his description of the laws of nature, his solution in the civil laws, and the teleological approach which underpins all of his writing. Hobbes has already proclaimed the broad equality of men (Chapter 13) and the fact for each man ‘good’ and ‘evil’ signify personal ‘appetites and aversions’ (Chapter 15). Hobbes’s opinions must fall into the same category. While this is a fairly generic criticism of moral relativism itself, and in no way exclusive to Hobbes, it becomes more problematic when we recall that Hobbes’s approach is distinctly teleological. The argument in Leviathan is centred around attaining a society in which,  exists ‘pleasure’, ‘place for industry’, ‘culture’, ‘time’, ‘arts’, ‘letters’, ‘society’  and more (Chapter 13), a society which, in short, Hobbes values. 
    
    Why the Sovereignty must be undivided 
    
    The concept of sovereignty being ‘undivided’ refers both the the unity of power being centralised in the power of one institution, but also the necessity for that same institution to hold all of the forms of power. On this former point Hobbes makes clear his preference for monarchical rule over the aristocratic or democratic alternatives. He makes the point that ‘a monarch is subject to no other inconsistency than that of human nature’ whereas assemblies presumably demonstrate the same ‘inconsistency...of human nature’ but this is coupled with ‘inconsistency from number’(Chapter 16). Nevertheless, Hobbes himself provides a solution to the latter criticism of ‘inconsistency from number’ but suggesting that in times of gridlock ‘the voice of the greater must be considered as the voice of them all’ (Chapter 16). By arguing for the will of the ‘greater’, Hobbes is defending a majoritarian outlook that contradicts his conviction that power be vested in one, which is perhaps why he views monarchical systems as simpler. 
    
    Secondly, the powers of the sovereign must not be distributed among other people, ‘undivided’ means they are ‘incommunicable and inseparable’  for by relinquishing part of the power e.g. ‘transfer the militia’ he ‘retains the judicature in vain’ (Chapter 18) for cannot enforce laws. The inspiration for this requirement harks from the English Civil War and Hobbes relates how ‘if there had not first been an opinion received of the greatest part of England that these powers were divided between the King and the Lords and the House of Commons, the people had never been divided and fallen’ (Chapter 18).. 
    
    Lastly, ‘undivided-ness’ is a concept inextricably linked to the sovereign in so far as he ought to represent ‘a multitude of men’ (Chapter 16). Hobbes argues that the strength of the sovereign position arises when their actions ‘are avouched by them all, and performed by the strength of them all in him united’ (Chapter 18), indeed, the covenant is only successful if all men claim responsibility or ‘own’ the actions of the sovereign. Tarlton argues that the power of the sovereign is ‘qualified’ by merit of it being ‘rooted in the cooperative and combined powers of the subjects’ (1999: 224) Nevertheless, this qualification is impaired by the ultimate lack of review which gives rise to ‘the rights and consequences’ of ‘a Sovereign by Institution’ being akin to those of ‘both Paternall and Despotical dominion’ (Chapter 20). Hence while the sovereign ought to represent a multitude of men and receive his legitimacy from them, in practice, the citizen’s lack of recourse to constrain the actions of the sovereign, mean he is unlike to realize himself as a figure of unity, as was Hobbes’s intention.   
    
    Conclusion
    
    Thus, Hobbes’s reasons for advocating that sovereign power be ‘absolute’ and ’undivided’ stem from his appraisal of the state of nature. Yet, they are also informed by his ambitions for society and appraisal of a functioning society; that which resembles his own. However, in his explanation of these states Hobbes commits himself to contradictions which undermine the magnetism of his solutions. Ultimately, his originality in perceiving a state of nature to be morally relativistic leads to the argument that his own ideas are also simply indicative of his ‘appetites and aversions’ (Chapter 15). Nevertheless, one cannot contest Hobbes’s originality in formulating the basis for a social contract, an idea which was to influence Locke, Rousseau and many more and become a fundamental concept in the history of European political ideas.
