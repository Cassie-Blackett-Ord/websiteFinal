  <h1> 
    This essay will argue that the statement ‘rule of law will succeed only if it gets at the fundamental problem of leaders who refuse to be ruled by the law’ is a sound evaluation of the present circumstances in Russia. The essay will demonstrate the validity of this statement through a thorough examination of the state of the judiciary in Russia. The author will demonstrate the fundamentally destructive effect leaders ‘refusing to be ruled by the law’ has on the legal, political and civil spheres.The essay will offer a brief summary of the arguments surrounding the question of rule of law in Russia, before offering a definition of rule of law. The ensuing paragraphs will address whether Russia abides by the given definition of rule of law. The author will consider the historical problems which challenge the development of the rule of law, specifically the legacy of communism. The author will then examine the structural problems of the legal system; namely the three columns of the judiciary, and assess the extent to which each of these columns adheres to the rule of law. The author will find that efficiency of each column of justice is undermined by bribery and corruption, linked to regional, federal and national leaders. The author will then consider public complicity in the failure of the rule of law and the extent to which the Russian populace can be considered legally nihilistic, and the extent to which this is perpetuated by political leaders. The essay will conclude by reviewing the consequences of lack of a rule of law on a state’s political and economic future.

    Background

    The question as to whether ‘Russian courts constrain the state’ or instead favour ‘state actors over other litigants’ (Popova, 2006: 391) has conventionally been answered in the confident affirmative. General suspicion towards Russia has been an overhanging feature of the post-Soviet years (Shleifer and Treisman, 2000) (Rosefielde, 2005), which has consolidated somewhat in recent years with the apparently ‘pre-ordained’ trials of Khodorkovsky, Magnitsky and Navalny (Hendley, 2009: 246). Nevertheless, while ostensibly Russia is lacking the ‘rule of law’ political scientists note that ‘Russians are taking their mundane disputes to the court in ever-increasing numbers’ (Hendley, 2014: 145), which would suggest a confidence in the judicial institutions. Moreover, Popova argues ‘existing literature’ is ‘cautiously optimistic about the growing power and discretion of the courts’ and ‘increased demand for law among Russian public’ ( 2006: 392-3) citing articles by Hendley (2002) and Frye (2002) This implies that Medvedev’s allegation that ‘Russia is a country of legal nihilism’ is misguided, or at least due for review (Polnyi Tekst, 2008). Certainly, there is no longer the ‘outright violence and coercion of the 1990s’ (Gans-Morse, 2012: 265), yet this is perhaps because legal challenges have become more insidious. 
    
    What is Rule of Law
    
    If a state is to become one ruled by the law, it is imperative leaders allow themselves to be ruled by the law as well. This essay will use a ‘thin’ definition for rule of law: namely the ‘requirement of equal justice for all’ (Hendley, 2009: 241). Hendley elaborates that this means an individual’s ‘political views or economic influence’ (2012: 150) become irrelevant, and subsequently the body of this essay will focus upon analysing the extent to which these aspects are irrelevant in the eyes of a court in Russia today.  When political scientists analyse the ‘rule of law’ there is a common tendency to create Western-centric definitions that prescribe certain values. Consequently, this essay will avoid ‘thick’ definitions which tend to assume ‘that all countries share the Western commitment to civil and property rights’ (Hendley, 2014: 155) (Moller and Skaaving, 2010). Analysis of the ‘rule of law’ considers the extent to which laws are enforced in a consistent manner, not the content of the laws themselves, and hence qualitative questions belong elsewhere. Nevertheless, in our analysis of Russia it is relevant to consider whether any community ‘fully achieves the ideal of the rule of law’ (Endicott, 1999:1). Endicott argues there is always a gap in the expectations set forth in legal theory and the reality of their enforcement, which is ‘only because of official infidelity to law, and the failure of lawmakers to pursue the ideal’ (Endicott, 1999: 1). Popova expands on this failure to attain total objectivity ‘they are never completely free from political commitment on their decision making’, not ‘even in the US’ (2006: 395), which is significant due to the similar federal layout and politicised process of appointing Supreme Court judges. Both Endicott and Popova believe that expecting complete neutrality is unrealistic, yet the onus is still upon political leaders to set a precedent of near neutrality. As a result, Endicott links a lack of rule of law to the concept of arbitrary government, in which a society is governed without recourse to a law, and possesses any or all of the three characteristics: 1. ‘Gives effect to the unconstitutional will of the ruler - as in an absolute dictatorship’. 2. ‘Does not treat people consistently’. 3. Is ‘unpredictable… does not tell its citizens where they stand, what their rights and duties are’ (Endicott, 1999: 3). These characteristics can be paraphrased as a government lacking ‘ constraint, consistency or certainty’ and is hence opposed to rule of law, which should offer all three (Endicott, 1999: 3).  Arbitrary government is the name given to the very concept of ‘leaders who refuse to be ruled by the law’ and therefore underlines the links between rule of law and the political leaders. If a government is being governed arbitrarily the rule of law is impossible, equally where a society functions under the rule of law, arbitrary government cannot occur.
