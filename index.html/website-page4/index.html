  <h1> 
    In the contemporary age it seems self-evident that a thorough evaluation of society must involve an examination of the individual. Yet, when both Mill and Nietzsche were writing in the late 1800s this was not the case. The first fifty years of the 19th century had been defined by philosophers’ search for a comprehensive philosophy for human life, be it Idealism, Bentham’s Utilitarianism or Communism, and in the process the individual had all but been overlooked.  So much so that in his introduction Courtney argues that On Liberty’s ‘general spirit and ...some of its special tendencies ...belongs rather to the standpoint of the eighteenth century than to that which saw its birth’ (1901: Introduction). Thus Mill, and latterly Nietzsche's focus on the individual, distinguished them in a period in which the social was preferred. They are also distinguished by the surprising similarities of their appraisals of society, their abhorrence of custom, defence of individuality, and practical approach to suffering. Despite this, their overarching philosophies are radically different, Mill subscribing to a revised Utilitarianism, Nietzsche to a subjective moral code of his own devising. In this essay I will attempt to understand how their theories overlap, at the same time as unravelling two complex and misunderstood philosophical approaches.

  <h2>      
Average individual

It is tempting,  when considering the role of the individual in both Mill’s and especially Nietzsche's work, to overlook the average individual for the outstanding individual; referred to by our authors as ‘the genius’ (1859: 80) and ‘the sovereign individual’ (1887: 37) respectively. Yet, naturally, to understand what each author considers exceptional we must first appreciate that which they consider the norm. Mill is ostensibly fairly derogatory about the average individual, denouncing man in general as having  ‘no nature to follow: their human capacities... withered and starved’ (1859: 77), a criticism compounded by the fact Mill uses the pronoun ‘they’ rather than ‘we’ and hence distances himself from this specimen of man. Similarly, Nietzsche’s ‘ultimate philosophical purpose lies in forging individuals who set value on (affirm) themselves’ (Gardner, 2009: 9) for the very reason that  ‘to have a character is to have a stable, unified, and integrated, hierarchy of drives’ which is ‘a very demanding condition most humans fail to meet.’ (1887: 38). Both therefore recognise a lack of ‘nature’ or ‘hierarchy of drives’ in the average person. Nietzsche’s formation of the problem encapsulates the essence of what both believed; custom renders most individuals ‘humans’ without ‘character’ (1887: 38).




Custom 

For Mill and Nietzsche, the role of custom, insofar as it regulates, predicts  and homogenizes the actions of those who abide by it must necessarily be the enemy of the individual.  The former bemoaned the man who ‘lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him’ and argued that he had ‘no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation’ (Mill, 1859: 75), while the latter defended the sovereign individual as the only man ‘liberated… from the morality of custom’ (Nietzsche, 1887: 37). Nietzsche's use of the verb ‘liberated’ is significant here, for it emphasises the fact that both find custom to restrict man’s comprehension of the opportunities available to him and consequently curtail man’s need to practice his reason.  The homogeneity of the prevailing moral custom invited the individual to consider whether ‘in this case everyone would have to act like this’ (Nietzsche, 1882: 335) and ‘What is suitable to my position?’(Mill, 1859: 77), rather than defer to their own feelings or judgement. Ultimately, the frustration with which the authors view the general obedience to custom reveals their respect for individual reasoning and a unique approach; in Mill this is referred to as the ‘variety of paths’ (1859: 88), which eccentricity - the very disobedience of custom - lends itself to. This explanation of custom goes some way to explaining the disparagement of our thinkers with regards to the average man. ‘The stunting and levelling of European man’ (Nietzsche, 1887: 25) through adherence to custom, naturally results in  man having ‘withered and starved’(1859: 77). Thus, the criticism, ostensibly leveled at the unremarkable individual, is instead directed towards custom and society. 

The Sovereign Individual/ Genius

The distinction in both authors between the unremarkable and remarkable varieties of men, has opened them to criticism of elitism. Certainly, Mill's defence of liberty is primarily driven - not by a concern for the average man, although he is a concern - but for the ‘eccentric’ (1859: 83) individual, who resists the persistent attempts by custom to wear ‘down into uniformity all that is individual’ (1859: 79).  It is by definition that ‘persons of genius’ fit into his category, as they must be ‘more individual than other people’(1859: 80) to be so. From this it logically follows that changes in society, which again by definition necessitate an amendment to convention, be brought about by those not already confined by ‘homogeneity ’(1859: 89). It is at this stage that critics of Mill begin their condemnation of his purported elitism, but this is unjust. Logic demands that an unusual needs a usual, an eccentric requires an ordinary and a genius entails a mediocre. Furthermore, his suggestion that ‘the initiation of all wise or noble things comes and must come from individuals’ (1859: 82)  is self evident insofar as it appeals to the constituent elements of a society: individuals. Hence for Mill it is impossible to consider the social without regards to the individual. As Courtney argues, perhaps ‘historically and in the order of Nature, the State is prior to the individual’ but ‘logically the individual is prior to the State’ (1901: Introduction).  A fundamental aspect of On Liberty is  the inseparability of good for the individual and  good for society and hence the collective benefit in individual freedom. 

This universal outlook is not exhibited in Nietzsche’s work. He not only does not focus on the social repercussions of his philosophy, but positively disdains man’s social ‘conscience’. His philosophy centres around the individual, yet despite declaring that ‘Every soul is a world of its own’ (1883-85: 234) he denies vehemently that this soul can have agency of its own ‘since it is completely a necessary consequence and is assembled from the elements and influences of past and present things’ (1878: 39). The anomaly - ‘the man who has his own independent, enduring will… this master of the free will’ (1887: 37) - is known as the sovereign individual. It is telling that when describing his sovereign individual Nietzsche uses the same word as Mill when Mill refers simply to the pursuit of life. ‘Nobility’ for the latter is accessible to each man, through his pursuit of higher pleasures, allowing ‘human beings’ - and the term is non-discriminatory - to ‘become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation.’ (1859: 79).  Whereas for the former it is an existential state quite inaccessible to the vast majority of humankind. Yet, this is not to equate the qualities which both esteem to be noble. Mill would unquestionably advocate man’s duty ‘to share’  (1863: 39) and writes extensively on social ‘duty’ (1863: 13) , both of which Nietzsche brands if not ignoble, then certainly misguided and weak characteristics (1886: 272). What is behind this divergence? Despite Mill’s focus on the character of the genius, we cannot forget his philosophy is founded upon Utility, requiring that the fulfilment and opportunity to ‘follow out any bold, vigorous, independent train of thought’ is validated in ‘proportion [to it tending] to promote happiness’ (Mill, 1863: 5). However, while their individuality means that geniuses are those who ‘introduce good things which did not before exist’ (1859: 80), this does not denote that the work of a genius must always be palpably beneficial to the rest of the world, but merely by the ‘refusal to bend the knee’ (1859: 82) they contribute to the ‘diversity of character and culture’ (1859: 88)  which enables humans to flourish. Conversely, Nietzsche's lack of respect for the average man (as undoubtedly linked to his obedience to custom) contaminates his opinion of society as a whole, insofar as it constituted of so-called ‘weaklings’ (1887: 29). Thus consequently, his philosophy of the sovereign individual has no such ‘Utility’ proviso, indeed his disdain for the unremarkable individual informs his condemnation of the ‘morality of compassion’ calling it the ‘most uncanny symptom of our European culture’ (1887: 7)  and even suggesting that his purpose in A Genealogy of Morality is to unseat it from its position in contemporary society (1887: 8). 

Suffering 

In the face of Nietzsche’s ambivalence towards the pain inflicted by the sovereign individual on his contemporaries, it is necessary to consider both Nietzsche’s and Mill’s opinions on the suffering of the individual in general. Given the  ‘Utility Principle’ asserts ‘actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness’ (Mill, 1863: 5), we would be forgiven for assuming, as is consistent with Bentham and James Mill’s Utilitarianism that JS Mill also simply sought to to maximise pleasure, and minimise pain. Yet in Utilitarianism Mill characterises ‘the view that life has… no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit - than pleasure’ as ‘worthy only of pigs’ (Mill, 1863: 5), due to the fact it implies all pleasures are equal. That there is a hierarchy in pleasures is evidenced from the fact that a man of intelligence ‘even if they were convinced that the fool, the dunce or the rascal is better satisfied with his life than they are with theirs’ would only in the ‘cases of unhappiness so extreme’ (Mill, 1863: 6) wish to exchange their situation. The man with higher capacities such as these, is also probably ‘capable of more acute suffering, and is certainly vulnerable to suffering at more points, than someone of an inferior type’ (Mill, 1863: 6). This idea is reinforced in Nietzsche, in which asceticism - encapsulated by the three words ‘poverty, humility, chastity’ (1887: 78) - becomes a tool with which to challenge life. The persisting in an ascetic life becomes the struggle ‘for supreme control against animals, nature and gods’ (1887: 88) through man’s mastery of himself. Thus despite Mill’s general wish to avoid, or minimise suffering he seems, like Nietzsche to acknowledge its value in manifesting individual expression.

However, Nietzsche's embrace of ascetic virtue appears incompatible with his apparent denunciation of the slave morality. He asserts that under the slave morality ‘impotence which doesn’t retaliate is being turned into “goodness”; timid baseness is being turned into “humility”’ (1887: 27), reiterating the very word ‘humility’ with which he used to describe the noble state of asceticism. What justifies both thinkers’ inconsistent approaches to the subject of suffering? I would argue it depends on whether the suffering is self inflicted or not. Both note the wretched state of suffering under another. Mill’s very philosophy is imbued with methods to ensure the defence of the ‘flock’ against the ‘vultures’ and ‘harpies’ (1859: 23) while Nietzsche describes how suffering engenders the belief ‘We weak people are just weak; it is good to do nothing’ (1887: 27)  and hence obliterates man’s true power. Yet, both equally appreciate the scope for individual development through suffering, and see it as fundamental to the attainment of progress. Indeed, Nietzsche argues the very ‘‘development’ of a thing…is a succession of more or less profound, more or less mutually independent processes of subjugation exacted on the thing’ (1887: 51), while for Mill, one must suffer in order to develop one’s individuality, and it is ‘In proportion to the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable to himself , and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others’ (1859: 79). 

Essentially, and ironically, the philosophers both end up tacitly endorsing a particular type of individual: ‘autonomous’, ‘supra-ethical’ , independent’, ‘enduring ’ (1887: 37) ‘eccentric’ (1859: 83) with ‘originality of thought and action (Ibid: 81). Thus promoting defiance to the norm in the much the same way that custom promotes obedience to it. However, the fact that both, though advancing an ideology, do so for the sake of individual autonomy, perhaps makes it an unfair comparison. 


Conclusion

Ultimately however, it is not the divergence of the genius and the sovereign individual which distinguishes Mill’s conception of the individual from Nietzsche’s, but rather the conflict in their attitude and approach to the average man. Mill’s fundamental belief that any human being can ‘become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation’ (1859: 79) informs not just his philosophy of the individual but permeates his writings On Liberty, Utilitarianism and even the social work to which he dedicated himself to in his lifetime. Conversely, Nietzsche’s contempt for the average man is central to the rest of his canon, and precludes him from establishing - as Mill does - a morality for society. By considering both thinkers’ appraisals of the suffering of the individual, the fundamental links between the genius, the sovereign individual and their authors’ emphasis on fulfilment is demonstrated. Yet while the goal for Mill is fulfilment for all individuals, for Nietzsche it is only some.
