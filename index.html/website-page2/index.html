  <h1> 
    It is something of a historical trope to suggest that a son has failed to escape from his father’s long shadow, yet in the case of the Holy Roman Emperors: Ferdinand I and Maximilian II the cliché is apt. While, most historians have been in agreement that Ferdinand I was ‘without doubt one of the most important figures of the reformation’ (Chisholm, 2008: 551) albeit in an understated, ‘consistently conventional’ (Sutter Fichtner, 1982: 3) manner, they have been unanimous in dismissing Maximilian as ‘a hypocrite’ (Goetz, 1996: 193), ‘a heretic’ (Wolff, 2001: 133), ‘and ethically bankrupt’ (Sutter Fichtner, 2001: 3). Yet, while accusations of Maximilian II meeting ‘ignominious defeat in battle against the Ottoman armies’ (Sutter Fichtner, 2001: 2) are indeed valid, the criticism that he ‘worked in vain to ease doctrinal tensions’ (Sutter Fichtner, 2001:2) and failed, is less straightforward. It is undeniable that Maximilian II lacked his father’s Catholic conviction, but it is less clear as to whether this hindered him, indeed Evans cites his ‘suspected…apostacy’, ‘frigid reserve towards…the Pope’, and refusal of ‘the Catholic sacraments’ as contributing to him being ‘a tolerant ruler’ (1979: 19-20). This essay will argue against the prevailing historical consensus that sees Maximilian as not only a ‘failure’ (Sutter Fichtner, 2001: 2) but also antithetical to his father in terms of his dealings with religious strife. Instead it will suggest that Maximilian’s tenure as a Central European ruler was marked with subtlety and an attitude of conciliation, and his dual approach of ‘power or evenhanded mediation’ (Sutter Fichtner, 2001: 155) is a technique directly inherited from his father.

    Sutter Fichtner argues that Maximilian’s rule was coloured by ‘short lived displays of power’ (2001: 155) while Ferdinand was remarkable for his ‘moderate, open-handed and tenacious approach’ (Sutter Fichtner, 1982: 3). Yet the latter’s early years commit him to the criticism levelled at his son. Central to Ferdinand I’s sense of personal legitimacy was the idea that ‘rule came through divine mandate… and the office of Holy Roman Empire came from God’ (Sutter Fichtner, 1982:4). This sense of entitlement - a recurring trait in the early Habsburgs - instilled Ferdinand with confidence in his own beliefs, and a duty to protect those beliefs throughout his empire, but also resulted in myopia in terms of appreciating the appeal of Lutheranism and other confessional faiths. It was because his own ‘commitment to Rome did not waver’ (Evans, 1979: 19) that he viewed the political and religious chaos with ‘incomprehension’ (Sutter Fichtner, 1982: 7). This religious absolutism is clearly seen in his early years as a ruler. Ferdinand was entrusted the Austrian lands in 1521, significant as the year of the Diet of Worms where Luther refused to recant. In November of the following year, Ferdinand released the first Austrian Habsburg mandate criticising Lutheranism (Chisholm, 2008: 555). This was followed by a personal mandate issued at the following Imperial diet in 1524, entitled ‘Concerning Luther’ which ‘shows a tougher stance’ (Chisholm, 2008: 555). More damning legislation was released in May of 1524 after a ‘convent of Imperial Catholic princes...to counter Luther’ (Chisholm, 2008: 555) chaired by Ferdinand I. The assembly produced two statements; one being a papal program ‘The Regensburg Reformation’ which listed reforms for the clergy, the other, ‘The Regensburg Recess’ was simply an announcement which included the warning that ‘we will punish the offenders of imperial law in our principalities and dioceses with expulsion’’ (Chisholm, 2008: 555).
